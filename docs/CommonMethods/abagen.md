# abagen

`abagen` is a Python package that can be used to work with [Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA)](https://human.brain-map.org) genetics data.
This is a great package if you want to use parcellated microarray expression maps in your own analysis.
`abagen` has already implemented a few atlases, but you can provide any atlas of your choosing as well.
Full documentation and code for working with `abagen` can be accessed [here](https://abagen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#).
If you want to learn more about AHBA gene expression data and the `abagen` toolbox, [Arnatkevic̆iūtė et al., 2019, *NeuroImage*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.01.011) and [Markello et al., 2021, *eLife*](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.72129) are great resources.
