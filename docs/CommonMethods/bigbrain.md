# BigBrain

BigBrain is a high-resolution histological atlas of a single post-mortem human brain (65 year old male) ([Amunts et al., 2013, *Science*](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1235381)).
`BigBrainWarp` is a Python toolbox that can be used to access BigBrain data and integrate the histological data with neuroimaging data and other neurobiological data types.
`BigBrainWarp` has an extensive documentation on how to use the toolbox and work with BigBrain data.
Full documentation and example code for `BigBrainWarp` are accessible [here](https://bigbrainwarp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
If you want to learn more about `BigBrainWarp`, check out this article by [Paquola et al., 2021, *eLife*](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.70119).
