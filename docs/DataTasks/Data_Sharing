# Policies for requesting/sharing data
_Note: this draft conceptualizes what data sharing may look like after post-bac data analysts are no longer on the informatics team_

### Internal collaborations
1. Speak to Ted about the data required to finalize the data needed for the request and nail down inclusion criteria
2. Post on #informatics team, tagging a point-person flagged by Ted to ask for the data
3. Communicate with the point-person on the open-channel to determine the best way to get data

#### For data on PMACS
- Transfer ALL data to a relevant CUBIC project/ create a new project as needed via datalad cloning, as described on this website
- Make a directory formatted as follows: `LastName_ProjectName_Year` and work inside the directory if you are using an old project. 
- Filter data by inclusion criteria
- Make sure to "datalad get" all data that meet inclusion criteria/are needed for analyses before running any pipelines on the data - 'datalad get's during a pipeline can kill PMACS


#### For data on CUBIC
- Make sure to work in a relevant project/ create a new one as needed
- Make a directory formatted as follows: `LastName_ProjectName_Year` and work inside the directory if you are using an old project
- Filter data by inclusion criteria

#### For external data
- Transfer ALL data to CUBIC. Make sure to work in a relevant project/ create a new one as needed
- Make sure to transfer the data to a dropbox that the project user can `scp` files out of, so that the project user has read-write access to the data
- Make a directory formatted as follows: `LastName_ProjectName_Year` and work inside the directory if you are using an old project
- Filter data by inclusion criteria

Then proceed to work with the data. 

### External collaborations
These may very well depend on what softwares our collaborators have access to. We often use Box, tar zipping data before uploading it. Other methods may be necessary and this is a case-by-case basis. 

General guidelines for external data sharing are as below: 

1. When sharing datasets, we will send ALL data available. 
2. Inclusion criteria will be decided by us before the data transfer, and shared with the data recipients.
3. Data recipients will confirm the inclusion criteria.

Note: If someone wants ABCD data, we will interactively zoom call with them to get a transfer set up.

Make sure to communicate about the status of the project and keep collaborators in the loop, also being available for questions after the data is successfully transferred.
